# 🚀 Before it fades - entry into "Pirate Software - Game Jam 15"

It is a simple and small text adventure about processed computer, random guy and Alchemist. Ideally while the game happens really mundane text and UI slowly turn into magical environment.

Joseph bought Abulafia just as a hipster decoration. In reality Abulafia is a computer that is possessed by a famous alchemist. Being possessed gave Abulafia a soul and stopped being just another Olivetti computer.
Joseph becomes possessed by the computer. Player actually plays as that famous alchemist controlling the computer that controls Joseph.
Through the game the player realizes that they control several entities instead of one.
Realization comes through minor changes to the UI that are non intrusive. This is not implemented at the moment.

The only implemented game mechanic is fading of the text while player progresses.

I don't have any illusions that this is steam ready. I just wanted to create playable and repayable game entry that works and has all the parts and fulfills all the formal criteria.
